  An attacker
  $\PARTY{E}$
  interacts with
  $\PARTY{T}$,
  which stores the embedded, security-critical data (#3),
  as follows:

  \begin{center}
  #2
  \end{center}

  \noindent
  Each interaction can be described as a series of potentially adaptive
  steps, where
  \IfStrEq{#6}{}{%
    1) $\PARTY{E}$
       provides some  input (#4) to
       $\PARTY{T}$,

       performs the computation detailed (#5);
       note that {\em no} output is produced by
       $\PARTY{T}$,
       implying, e.g., that it uses the provided input internally.

\providecommandx{\DESCMATERIALCONF}[1]{%
  This file represents a set of attack parameters, including everything 
  (e.g., all public values) 
  that
  $\PARTY{E}$ 
  has access to by default.  More specifically, it contains
  
  \begin{itemize}
  #1
  \end{itemize}
  
  \noindent
  using one field per line.
}%
\providecommandx{\DESCMATERIALT}[2]{%
  This executable simulates interaction with the attack target 
  $\PARTY{T}$.  
  When executed it will
   read the following  input
  
  \begin{itemize}
  #1
  \end{itemize}
  
  \noindent
  from 
  \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdin}
  using one field per line,
  and then
  write the following output (one field per line)
  
  \begin{itemize}
  #2
  \end{itemize}
  
  \noindent
  to   
  \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout}
  using one field per line.
  Execution continues this way, 
  i.e., repeatedly reading input then writing output, 
  until terminated by the user or some form of internal error.
}%
\providecommandx{\DESCMATERIALR}[1]{%
  In many side-channel and fault attacks, the attacker is able to perform an 
  initial profiling or calibration phase: a common rationale for doing so is 
  to support selection or fine-tuning of parameters for a subsequent attack.  
  With this in mind, a simulated replica 
  $\PARTY{R}$ 
  of the attack target is also provided.
  $\PARTY{R}$ 
  is identical to 
  $\PARTY{T}$, 
  bar the fact it
   reads the following  input (one field per line)
  
  \begin{itemize}
  #1
  \end{itemize}
  
  \noindent
  from 
  \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdin}.
}%

\providecommandx{\DESCTASKIMPL}[2]{%
  Write a program that simulates the attacker
  $\PARTY{E}$,
  by interacting with and attacking the simulated attack target, i.e.,
  realising the goal of recovering the target material 
  #1.
  When executed using a command of the form
  \[
  #2
  \]
  the attack should be invoked on the named simulated attack target.
  Use 
  \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout} 
  to record any intermediate output you deem relevant, followed finally 
  by two lines which clearly detail
  a) the target material recovered,
     plus
  b) the total number of interactions with the simulated attack target
     that were required to do so.
