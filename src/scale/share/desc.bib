% - The format of entry keys is
%
%   SCALE:<author key>:<publication year>[a-z]
%
%   i.e., a domain separator, followed by the author key and two-digit 
%   publication year (using XX to denote undated), optionally followed 
%   by a character to allow resolution of conflicts (with separating 
%   colons where appropriate),
%
% - The format of author keys depends on the number of authors:
%
%   -       1-author         =>                       full (ASCII'ised) last name, e.g., "W.M. Hu"                                                            => Hu
%   - 2- or 3-author         => first 3 characters of each (ASCII'ised) last name, e.g., "O. Ac\i{}i\c{c}mez and \c{C}.K. Ko\c{c}"                            => AciKoc
%   -       4-author or more => first 1 character  of each (ASCII'ised) last name, e.g., "Y. Wang and A. Ferraiuolo and D. Zhang and A.C. Myers and E.G. Suh" => WFZMS
