1.r ! The vendor of the attack target is concerned that news of this attack 
    ! could scare off potential customers; they will make any alteration 
    ! necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent the attack.  Explain 
    ! the options they have, and which one you would recommend.
2.r ! The vendor of the attack target is concerned that a similar attack may
    ! also apply to their implementation of the ElGamal encryption scheme.  
    ! Explain the potential for such an attack, and how it differs from the
    ! case of RSA.

3.o ! Your implementation of this attack will use some form of statistical 
    ! test.  Explain what test you have used, how it works, and also how it 
    ! compares with at least one alternative.
4.o ! Numerous factors might produce noise within measurements of execution
    ! time: based on the given attack target and context, outline at least
    ! two examples.
5.o ! The level of noise, n, within measurements of execution time will 
    ! influence the number of measurements, m, required for a successful
    ! attack.  Explain what the relationship between n and m is (i.e.,
    ! how you expect m to grow as n grows).
6.o ! Let n denote the number of simulated clock cycles required to execute
    ! a Montgomery multiplication on the attack target.  Estimate the value 
    ! of n (as accurately as you can) and explain how you did so.
7.o ! Imagine the attack target vendor asks you to update the implementation
    ! of binary exponentiation with a windowed alternative.  Which algorithm
    ! would you recommend they use?  Discuss the advantages/disadvantages of
    ! your choice in terms of latency, memory footprint, and (side-channel)
    ! security.
8.o ! Imagine you read a research paper that suggests a larger key (e.g., 
    ! 2048-bit rather than 1024-bit) could help to prevent this attack.  
    ! Explain whether and why you think this is right (or wrong).
