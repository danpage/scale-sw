\leveldown{Background}

Imagine you are tasked with attacking a device, denoted 
$\PARTY{T}$, 
which houses an $8$-bit Intel $8051$ micro-processor.  More specifically,
$\PARTY{T}$ 
represents an ISO/IEC 7816 compliant contact-based smart-card used within 
larger devices as a cryptographic co-processor module: 
using a standardised protocol (or API), it supports secure key generation 
and storage plus off-load of some cryptographic operations.
\DESCINTRO[fault]
{\input{desc.tikz}}
{a cipher key}
{a  plaintext}
{i.e., it encrypts the plaintext using the cipher key}
{a ciphertext}
Note that
$\PARTY{E}$ 
provides a power supply and clock signal to 
$\PARTY{T}$;
direct access to the 
clock signal
means it is plausible 
for the former to influence the latter, e.g., causing a malfunction by supplying an irregular clock signal (or ``glitch'').
One malfunction, or fault, can be induced per interaction with 
$\PARTY{T}$: 
it will act to randomise one element of the state matrix used by AES-128, 
at a chosen point during the associated encryption.

\item $\FAULT$, 
      a  fault specification
                                                                     (the format and semantics of which are explained further below),

\item $\PUB{c}$,
      a  ${1}$-block AES-128 ciphertext
      (represented as a  length-prefixed, hexadecimal octet   string),
}%
Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PARTY{T}$ uses an AES-128 implementation,
      which clearly implies $128$-bit block and cipher key lengths;
      following the notation in~\cite[Figure 5]{SCALE:FIPS:197:01}, the 
      fact that 
      $
      Nb =  4
      $ 
      and 
      $
      Nr = 10
      $ 
      means a $( 4 \times 4 )$-element state matrix is used in a total of 
      $11$ rounds
      where

      \begin{itemize}
      \item the  $0$-th           round  consists of the
            \lstinline{AddRoundKey}
            round function  alone,
      \item the  $1$-st to $9$-th rounds consist  of the
            \lstinline{SubBytes}, \lstinline{ShiftRows},  \lstinline{MixColumns}, then  \lstinline{AddRoundKey}
            round functions,
            and
      \item the $10$-th           round  consists of the
            \lstinline{SubBytes}, \lstinline{ShiftRows},                          then  \lstinline{AddRoundKey}
            round functions.
      \end{itemize}

\item More concretely, it is an $8$-bit, memory-constrained implementation
      with the S-box held as a $\SI{256}{\byte}$ look-up table in memory. 
      In line with the goal of minimising the memory footprint, the round
      keys are not pre-computed: each encryption takes the cipher key and
      evolves it forward, step-by-step, to form successive round keys for
      use during key addition.  
\item The fault specification is {\em either} a comma-separated line of the
      form
      \[
      r, f, p, i, j
      \]
      where

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $r$  
            (represented as a decimal integer string)
            specifies the round in which the fault occurs,
            implying $0 \leq r < 11$,
      \item $f$
            (represented as a decimal integer string)
            specifies the round function in which the fault occurs via
            \[
            f = \left\{\begin{array}{ll@{\;}l@{\;}l}
                       0 & \mbox{~for a fault in the} & \mbox{\lstinline{AddRoundKey}} & \mbox{round function} \\
                       1 & \mbox{~for a fault in the} & \mbox{\lstinline{SubBytes}   } & \mbox{round function} \\
                       2 & \mbox{~for a fault in the} & \mbox{\lstinline{ShiftRows}  } & \mbox{round function} \\
                       3 & \mbox{~for a fault in the} & \mbox{\lstinline{MixColumns} } & \mbox{round function}
                       \end{array}
                \right.
            \]
      \item $p$
            (represented as a decimal integer string)
            specifies whether the fault occurs before or after execution 
            of the round function via
            \[
            p = \left\{\begin{array}{ll@{\;}l@{\;}l}
                       0 & \mbox{~for a fault} & \mbox{before} & \mbox{the round function} \\
                       1 & \mbox{~for a fault} & \mbox{after}  & \mbox{the round function} 
                       \end{array}
                \right.
            \]
            and
      \item $i$ and $j$
            (both represented as decimal integer strings),
            specify the row and column of the state matrix which the 
            fault occurs in,
            implying $0 \leq i, j < 4$
      \end{enumerate}

      \noindent
      {\em or} a blank line.  In the latter case, {\em no} fault will 
      be induced; this will obviously yield the correctly encrypted 
      ciphertext for a given plaintext.
\item The fault randomises one element of the state matrix: this can be
      captured by writing the resulting value as $s_{i,j} \XOR \delta$ 
      where $\delta$ is a (random) difference introduced by the fault.
\IfEq{CONF(ALLOW_ZERO,CID)}{1}{%
      Keep in mind that faults such that 
      $
      \delta = 0
      $ 
      {\em are} possible, and, since
      $
      s_{i,j} \XOR \delta = s_{i,j} \XOR 0 = s_{i,j} ,
      $
      this effectively means no fault will be induced in such cases.
}{%
      You can assume $\delta \neq 0$, i.e., a fault will {\em always} be
      induced {\em if} you attempt to do so.
