1.r ! As a security consultant, you have been working on a prototype of the
    ! attack target; before the product is deployed, the vendor is willing 
    ! to make any alteration necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent 
    ! the attack.  Explain the options available, and which one you would 
    ! recommend.
2.r ! Consider that instead of influencing state (or data)
    ! an induced fault might influence control-flow during execution.  
    ! Stating any assumptions you make, give an alternative attack strategy 
    ! based on this ability.

3.o ! The question involves one mechanism for inducing faults (i.e., via a 
    ! clock glitch).  Write down a set of alternative mechanisms, and then
    ! explain whether or not each one is applicable given the context.
4.o ! For side-channel attacks, the number of acquisitions required can be
    ! used as a measure of efficiency.  Outline the equivalent measure for 
    ! fault attacks, and explain whether (and why) you think a side-channel 
    ! attack on the same target could be as efficient as a fault attack.
5.o ! Imagine that instead of a Gauss-based recombination step, the target 
    ! device uses a Garner-based recombination step.  How does this impact
    ! the attack strategy, i.e., is an attack still possible?  If so, what 
    ! alterations are required; if not, why not?
