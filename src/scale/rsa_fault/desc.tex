\leveldown{Background}

Imagine you are tasked with attacking a device, denoted 
$\PARTY{T}$, 
which houses an $8$-bit Intel $8051$ micro-processor.  More specifically,
$\PARTY{T}$ 
represents an ISO/IEC 7816 compliant contact-based smart-card used within 
larger devices as a cryptographic co-processor module: 
using a standardised protocol (or API), it supports secure key generation 
and storage plus off-load of some cryptographic operations.
\DESCINTRO[leak+fault]
{\input{desc.tikz}}
{a private key}
{a message}
{i.e. it signs the message using the private key}
{a signature}
Note that
$\PARTY{E}$ 
provides a power supply and clock signal to 
$\PARTY{T}$;
direct access to the 
clock signal
means it is plausible 
for the former to influence the latter, e.g., causing a malfunction by supplying an irregular clock signal (or ``glitch'').

\item $\FAULT$
      a  fault specification
      (represented as a                       decimal integer string, the format and semantics of which are explained further below),
\item $\PUB{m}$,
      a message
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
}{
\item $\LEAK$,
      an execution latency measured in clock cycles
      (represented as a                       decimal integer string),
      and
\item $\PUB{\SIG}$,
      an RSA signature on $\PUB{m}$
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
}%
Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item Internally, 
      $\PARTY{T}$ 
      uses a co-processor to support multi-precision integer arithmetic: by
      storing operands in an internal, special-purpose register file, it is
      able to perform single-cycle computation of modular
           inversion (i.e., $1 / x     \pmod{n}$),
            negation (i.e., $  - x     \pmod{n}$),
            addition (i.e., $x +     y \pmod{n}$),
         subtraction (i.e., $x -     y \pmod{n}$),
      and
      multiplication (i.e., $x \cdot y \pmod{n}$).
\item $\PARTY{T}$ 
      uses the co-processor to realise a CRT-based~\cite{SCALE:QuiCou:82} 
      implementation of RSA decryption, using a Gauss-based recombination 
      step.
\item $\PARTY{E}$
      can induce a fault, via a ``glitch'' in the clock signal supplied to
      $\PARTY{T}$;
      the fault is controlled using $\FAULT$, in the sense that
      \[
      \begin{array}{c@{\;}c@{\;}c c c@{\;}l}
      \FAULT &<   & 0 &\Rightarrow& \mbox{no} & \mbox{fault induced                        } \\
      \FAULT &\geq& 0 &\Rightarrow&           & \mbox{fault induced in clock cycle $\FAULT$} \\
      \end{array}
      \]
      Through analysis of the fault model, it is known that inducing a fault 
      will impact the co-processor ALU; if a fault is induced in clock cycle
      $\FAULT$, computation by (or output of) the ALU in that clock cycle is
      corrupted (or randomised).
