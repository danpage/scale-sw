1.r ! Fundamentally, the attack is enabled by the specific implementation 
    ! strategy employed for xtime.  *Other* implementation strategies are
    ! possible.  List as many correct, secure implementations of xtime
    ! you can think of, detailing how the implementation works and why it 
    ! prevents the attack; express each implementation as a C function.
2.r ! As well as improving efficiency, AES-NI can act as a countermeasure 
    ! against timing attacks that may otherwise be possible.  Explain what
    ! AES-NI is and how it is used to implement AES, then outline sources
    ! of data-dependent execution latency (and hence timing attacks) that
    ! it prevents.

3.o ! Your implementation of this attack will use some form of statistical 
    ! test.  Explain what test you have used, how it works, and also how it 
    ! compares with at least one alternative.
4.o ! Numerous factors might produce noise within measurements of execution
    ! latency: based on the attack target and context presented, outline at 
    ! least two examples.
