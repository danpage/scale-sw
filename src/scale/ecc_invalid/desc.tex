\leveldown{Background}

Imagine you own a cryptographic accelerator, denoted $\PARTY{T}$: it is used
as a low-cost HSM in your data center, supporting secure key generation and 
storage plus off-load of various cryptographic operations via a standardised 
protocol (or API).  $\PARTY{T}$ is primarily used to perform elliptic curve
scalar multiplication, meaning you can interact with it as follows:

\begin{center}
\input{desc.tikz}
\end{center}

\noindent
That is, in each interaction you can (adaptively) send 
a point
to $\PARTY{T}$; the accelerator will
multiply that point by the fixed, unknown scalar $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$,
and produce 
the corresponding point.
Although it currently functions correctly, an electrical fault demands that
$\PARTY{T}$ is replaced.  However, doing so presents a serious problem: the 
API cannot be used to export $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$, so a replacement will have 
to be generated and used thereafter.  This means compatibility with various
existing data sets will be lost, {\em unless} $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$ itself can 
be recovered by some other means.

\leveldown{\lstinline[language={bash}]|\$\{ARCHIVE\}/CONF(ARCHIVE_PATH,CID)/\$\{USER\}.T|}

This executable simulates the attack target $\PARTY{T}$.  When executed it 
 reads the following  input (one field per line)

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PUB{P_x}$,
      the $x$-coordinate of elliptic curve point $\PUB{P} = \TUPLE{ \PUB{P_x}, \PUB{P_y} }$
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
      and
\item $\PUB{P_y}$,
      the $y$-coordinate of elliptic curve point $\PUB{P} = \TUPLE{ \PUB{P_x}, \PUB{P_y} }$
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
\end{itemize}

\noindent
from \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdin},
and 
writes the following output (one field per line)

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PUB{Q_x}$,
      the $x$-coordinate of elliptic curve point $\PUB{Q} = \TUPLE{ \PUB{Q_x}, \PUB{Q_y} } = \PMUL{\PRI{\CHAL{k}}}{\PUB{P}}$
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
      and
\item $\PUB{Q_y}$,
      the $y$-coordinate of elliptic curve point $\PUB{Q} = \TUPLE{ \PUB{Q_x}, \PUB{Q_y} } = \PMUL{\PRI{\CHAL{k}}}{\PUB{P}}$
      (represented as a                   hexadecimal integer string),
\end{itemize}

\noindent
to   \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout}.
Execution continues this way, i.e., repeatedly reading input then writing 
output, until $\PARTY{T}$ is forcibly terminated (or crashes).
Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PARTY{T}$ uses an left-to-right binary scalar multiplication
      (i.e., an additive analogue of~\cite[Section 2.1]{SCALE:Gordon:85}) to 
      compute $\PUB{Q} = \PMUL{\PRI{\CHAL{k}}}{\PUB{P}}$: it assumes use of 
      the
      \IfStrEqCase{CONF(CURVE,CID)}{%
        {0}{NIST-P-192 }% NIST-P-192
        {1}{NIST-P-224 }% NIST-P-224
        {2}{NIST-P-256 }% NIST-P-256
        {3}{NIST-P-384 }% NIST-P-384
        {4}{NIST-P-521 }% NIST-P-521
      } elliptic curve
      \[
      E( \DOM{\B{F}_p} ) : y^2 = x^3 + \DOM{a_4} x + \DOM{a_6}
      \]
      for standardised~\cite{SCALE:FIPS:186:00} domain parameters $\DOM{p}$, 
      $\DOM{a_4}$ and $\DOM{a_6}$.
\item More concretely, $\PARTY{T}$ uses OpenSSL to support arithmetic on the
      elliptic curve.  You can browse the associated source code at
      \[
      \mbox{\url{http://github.com/openssl}}
      \]
      noting that the choice outlined above implies use of 
      \lstinline[language={C}]{ec_GFp_simple_add}
      and
      \lstinline[language={C}]{ec_GFp_simple_dbl}
      to realise the (additive) group operation, i.e., to compute either a
      point addition or doubling, within the scalar multiplication.
\item Crucially, $\PARTY{T}$ applies {\em no} checks to either the input or
      output points (e.g., to check whether 
      $
      \PUB{P} \in E( \DOM{\B{F}_p} )
      $ 
      and reject $\PUB{P}$ if not).
\item At least from a Mathematical point of view, there is no valid affine 
      representation of the point at infinity.  If computation of
      $
      \PMUL{\PRI{\CHAL{k}}}{\PUB{P}}
      $
      does yield the point at infinity, $\PARTY{T}$ therefore signals this 
      fact by producing
      \[
      \PUB{Q} = \TUPLE{ \PUB{Q_x}, \PUB{Q_y} } = \TUPLE{ 0, 0 }
      \]
      as output 
      (rather than some special-purpose mechanism, e.g., an error or an alternative output format).
\end{itemize}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\levelup{Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a program that simulates the adversary $\PARTY{E}$ by attacking
      the simulated target, or, more specifically, that recovers the target 
      material $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$.  
      When executed using a command of the form
      \[
      \mbox{\lstinline[language={bash}]|./attack \$\{USER\}.T|}
      \]
      the attack should be invoked on the simulated target named (not some
      hard-coded alternative).  Use \lstinline[language={bash}]{stdout} to 
      print 
      a) any intermediate output you deem relevant, followed finally by 
      b) two lines which clearly detail the target material recovered plus
         the total number of interactions with the attack target.
\item Answer the exam-style questions in 
      \lstinline[language={bash}]|${ARCHIVE}/CONF(ARCHIVE_PATH,CID)/${USER}.exam|.
\end{enumerate}
