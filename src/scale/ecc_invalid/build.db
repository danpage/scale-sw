1.r ! An obvious countermeasure against this attack is to validate the input
    ! (and potentially output) point; this is in fact a *required* step in 
    ! most standards.  Explain how this validation procedure works.
2.r ! If the protocol for interaction had used point compression, this could
    ! act as a countermeasure against the attack.  Explain what this concept
    ! means, and why the claimed countermeasure could be effective.

3.o ! As with most side-channel attacks, fewer interactions with the target
    ! device is preferable.  Present a formal argument (i.e., one not based
    ! on experimental evidence alone) that explains how many interactions
    ! you expect to make in this attack.
4.o ! Imagine the target device uses a key refreshing mechanism, such that 
    ! k differs for each interaction.  Providing some experimental evidence 
    ! where appropriate, assess the
    !
    ! a) theoretical (i.e., by using standard cryptanalysis, irrespective 
    !    of the context), and 
    ! b) effective   (i.e., as used concretely in this context) 
    !
    ! security levels of the EC-DLP associated with this curve.
