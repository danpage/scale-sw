\leveldown{Background}

Imagine you encounter a server, denoted 
$\PARTY{T}$, 
which houses an ageing but still operational $32$-bit Katmai model Intel 
Pentium III micro-processor.  
A datasheet for this micro-processor shows that it has a $16$ kilobyte, 
$4$-way set-associative L1 data cache with $32$ byte cache lines.  Since
around $1999$, the server has performed a mission-critical back-office 
role in a banking application: you discover it acts as a primitive form 
of HSM, performing DES encryption on behalf of front-end clients.
\DESCINTRO[leak]
{\input{desc.tikz}}
{a cipher key}
{a  plaintext}
{i.e., it encrypts the plaintext using the cipher key}
{a ciphertext}
Note that the ability to observe execution latency is plausible, because
$\PARTY{E}$ 
can simply record how long
$\PARTY{T}$ 
takes to respond with the output associated with a given input (noting the potential for experimental noise while doing so).

\item $\PUB{c}$,
      a  ${1}$-block DES ciphertext
      (represented as a  length-prefixed, hexadecimal octet   string), 
}%
Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\PARTY{T}$ uses a software implementation of DES, based on that
      written by Richard Outerbridge~\cite[Part V]{SCALE:Schneier:06}.
\item DES has a $64$-bit block length, and, although it notionally accepts 
      a $64$-bit cipher key, the {\em effective} cipher key length is in
      fact $56$ bits: the remaining $8$ bits support error detection via 
      a parity code.  You can ignore the parity bits, meaning {\em many}
      $64$-bit candidate cipher keys will be valid when used in place of 
      $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$ (since only the $56$ bits actually used by DES are 
      relevant).
\item The cited source code uses a set of eight separate S-box look-up 
      tables.  Each look-up table has $64$ entries of type 
      \lstinline[language=C]{unsigned long} 
      (i.e., a $64$-bit unsigned integer), so will consume $512$ bytes 
      of memory.  Doing so improves efficiency: a look-up table captures 
      the function of an associated S-box {\em plus} the (inefficient) 
      P- and E-permutations.  However, the implementation actually used 
      by $\PARTY{T}$ differs slightly.  Given each of the look-up table 
      entries holds $32$ bits of content, the type of entries has been 
      altered to 
      \lstinline[language=C]{unsigned int}. 
      Once loaded, an entry is simply cast into 
      \lstinline[language=C]{unsigned long},
      roughly halving the memory footprint with no impact on efficiency.
      Given the $32$-byte L1 cache line size, and that each look-up table 
      is aligned to a $32$-byte boundary, each cache line can therefore 
      accommodate eight full $32$-bit entries.
\item To perform the role described, the implementation

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item invokes the \lstinline[language=C]{deskey} function
            to pre-compute the round keys from a given cipher key,
            then
      \item invokes the \lstinline[language=C]{des}    function
            to perform an encryption operation.
      \end{enumerate}

      \noindent
      Within the 
      \lstinline[language=C]{des}
      function, 
      \lstinline[language=C]{scrunch} and \lstinline[language=C]{unscrun}
      are used to convert a sequence of eight $8$-bit bytes to and from a
      $64$-bit integer (held as two $32$-bit halves) before and after 
      \lstinline[language=C]{desfunc}
      performs the encryption operation itself.
\item You can assume that when an encryption operation is performed, i.e.,
      when the
      \lstinline[language=C]{des}
      function is invoked, the cache contains {\em no} S-box content: any
      cache-hits or -misses during encryption therefore depend only on 
      $\PRI{\CHAL{k}}$ and $\PUB{m}$, as does the execution latency.
\end{itemize}
