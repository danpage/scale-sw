1.r ! In common with other micro-architectural side-channel attacks, one
    ! perspective might be that the processor vendor is to blame; another
    ! is that whoever wrote the DES implementation is to blame.  What is 
    ! your opinion, and why?
2.r ! The cache geometry has significant influence on attacks like this; 
    ! an important example is the size of cache lines.  Imagine that the
    ! attack target is upgraded, and the new L1 cache has lines that can
    ! hold twice as much data.  What impact would such a change have on
    ! this attack?

3.o ! Numerous factors might produce noise within measurements of execution
    ! latency: based on the attack target and context presented, outline at 
    ! least two examples.
4.o ! Imagine you are asked to give some advice to a group designing a new
    ! block cipher.  Ignoring the implementation per se, what features of
    ! the *design* might help prevent cache-based attacks?
5.o ! One countermeasure against (some) cache-based attacks is to avoid 
    ! storing S-boxes as look-up tables in memory.  Focusing on AES as 
    ! an example, explain two approaches (each at a high-level only) which 
    ! could be used to realise such a countermeasure.
6.o ! One countermeasure against (some) cache-based attacks is to turn off 
    ! the cache.  Focusing on DES as an example, estimate the impact this 
    ! countermeasure would have on performance (carefully explaining your 
    ! reasoning).
