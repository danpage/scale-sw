1.r ! Consider the parameters
    ! N = 3551,
    ! e = 5,
    ! d = 1373,
    ! and
    ! c = 888,
    ! all represented in decimal.  Use them to explain, in your own words, 
    ! the principle of this attack (e.g., how and why it works).
2.r ! To prevent the attack, the vendor suggests altering the software: the
    ! idea is that no matter what error occurs, the same error code will be
    ! produced.  Explain whether (and why, or why not) this change alone is
    ! sufficient.

3.o ! Ignoring the use of countermeasures, carefully detail any situations 
    ! where your implementation of this attack could fail; given more time,
    ! what could you do to resolve this?
4.o ! This attack is based on the fact that decrypting a ciphertext of the
    ! form c = (f^e)*c' mod N produces a plaintext of the form f*m' mod N. 
    ! Show why this fact is true. 
5.o ! Explain how the concept of plaintext awareness relates to this attack.
6.o ! RSA has a homomorphic property: explain what this means, and how it
    ! relates to this attack.
7.o ! Side-channel attacks are often categorised as being either simple or
    ! differential: how would categorise this attack, and why?
8.o ! Imagine you are a security consultant, employed by the device vendor.
    ! The vendor has heard that exponent and message blinding can be used
    ! to prevent some side-channel attacks on RSA.  Explain whether these
    ! techniques would prevent this attack, and why.
