1.r ! As a security consultant, you have been working on a prototype of the
    ! attack target; before the product is deployed, the vendor is willing 
    ! to make any alteration necessary (in software or hardware) to prevent 
    ! the attack.  Explain the options available, and which one you would 
    ! recommend.
2.r ! The vendor of the attack target opts to replace the 8-bit Intel 8051 
    ! micro-processor with a modern, 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0; they supplement 
    ! it with hardware support for that allows single-cycle operations on 
    ! 32 bits of the AES state.  Doing so will naturally reduce the latency
    ! of encryption or decryption, but they *also* want to know if it might
    ! make the device more secure with respect to DPA attacks: what is your 
    ! assessment, and why ?

3.o ! DPA attacks work because statistics can (to some degree) remove the
    ! noise within power consumption traces.  Explain the concepts of 
    ! signal, noise and signal-to-noise ratio, and the role each has in a
    ! DPA attack of this type.
4.o ! DPA attacks include a statistical analysis step, for which one option
    ! is use of the t-test.  Explain what the difference between a standard 
    ! t-test and Kocher's method is.  Given that in a DPA attack one might 
    ! have unequal sets of measurements associated with 0 and 1, is a
    ! standard t-test actually an appropriate choice? 
5.o ! DPA attacks rely on a leakage model; for an Intel 8051, one might
    ! consider Hamming weight or Hamming distance models for example.
    ! Explain and justify the choice of model you used (e.g., explain
    ! why/how the attack target might leak information in this way).
6.o ! Your implementation of this attack will target some operation during
    ! execution of AES.  Identify which operation you target, and explain 
    ! why.  Outline other operation(s) you could have targeted, and why 
    ! they might be a better or worse choice.
7.o ! The power consumption traces you used in this attack are perfectly 
    ! aligned.  What does "alignment" mean in this context, and how could
    ! misalignment occur in practice?  How could you alter your attack 
    ! strategy to compensate for misalignment?
8.o ! The vendor of the attack target decides to use AES-192 rather than 
    ! AES-128; their argument is that longer keys will naturally improve 
    ! security in general *and* versus DPA attacks.  Explain if and why 
    ! you agree or disagree with this argument.
