\leveldown{Background}

Imagine you encounter a server, denoted 
$\PARTY{T}$, 
which acts as a storage repository for sensor data.  An installation of $50$ 
or so IoT-class sensor nodes regularly transmit encrypted packets of data to
$\PARTY{T}$, 
which stores them for later analysis (iff. they are deemed to be valid).  
Having already captured some encrypted packets transmitted by a target sensor
node, you are tasked with recovery of the underlying sensor data.
\DESCINTRO[none]
{\input{desc.tikz}}
{some key material}
{a ciphertext}
{i.e., it processes the ciphertext, as detailed further below}
{}
In more detail, the algorithm
$\ALG{Process}$
which captures the computation performed by
$\PARTY{T}$
can be described by the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item decrypt the $\PUB{l}$-block $\PUB{c}$, i.e., compute
      \[
      \PRI{m} \CONS \PRI{\TAG} \CONS \PRI{\PAD} = \SCOPE{\ID{AES-CBC}}{\ALG{Dec}}( \PRI{\CHAL{k}_1}, \PUB{iv}, \PUB{c} )
      \]
      then
\item check whether $\PRI{\PAD}$ is valid, 
      aborting immediately  and produce result code $1$ if not,
      then
\item check whether $\PRI{\TAG}$ is valid, i.e., whether 
      \[
      \SCOPE{\ID{HMAC-SHA-1}}{\ALG{Ver}}( \PRI{\CHAL{k}_2}, \PRI{m}, \PRI{\TAG} ) = \TRUE ,
      \]
      aborting immediately  and produce result code $2$ if not,
      then
\item process $\PRI{m}$ somehow,
                            and produce result code $0$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Since there is no (external) output, one might question how
$\PARTY{E}$
obtains the (internal) result code.  Doing so is plausible, because 
$\PARTY{E}$
can use execution latency as a proxy: since computation by
$\PARTY{T}$
early-aborts depending on the error condition, observation of the execution
latency is (modulo any experimental noise) suggestive of whether, when, and 
what error has occured.

Note that:

\begin{itemize}
\item To avoid attacks that leverage execution latency, 
      $\PARTY{T}$ 
      employs a high-performance yet constant-time AES-128 implementation 
      (operated in CBC mode) that is derived from~\cite{SCALE:KasSch:09};
      this implies $128$-bit block and cipher key lengths.  
\item Keep in mind some limitations, namely 
      $
      0 \leq \PUB{l} < 256 ,
      $
      on maximum plaintext and/or ciphertext length.
\item The \PKCS{7}[1.5]~\cite[Section 10.3]{SCALE:RFC:2315} padding scheme 
      is used: given a block size of $16$ bytes, define
      $
      \alpha = 16 - ( | \PRI{m} \CONS \PRI{\TAG} | \bmod 16 ) 
      $
      which implies that
      $
      1 \leq \alpha \leq 16 .
      $
      The padding can then be described as
      \[
      \PRI{\PAD} = \LIST{ \underbrace{ \alpha, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha }_{\mbox{$\alpha$ octets}} } ,
      \]
      i.e., a sequence of $\alpha$ octets each of whose value is $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
