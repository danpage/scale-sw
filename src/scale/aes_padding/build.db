1.r ! In the scenario presented, the attack target leaks information via
    ! poor control over the error messages, i.e., result code, produced.  
    ! Imagine that it is upgraded so a single type of error message is 
    ! possible: either there is an error, or no error.  Explain whether 
    ! or not, and how, you think the attack might still be viable.
2.r ! The attack target uses a padding scheme whereby p octets with the 
    ! value p are appended to the message, so the overall length is then
    ! a multiple of the block size.  Identify one alternative scheme, and
    ! explain how the attack might change as a result of using it.

3.o ! The maintainers of the server are keen to deploy a countermeasure
    ! against the attack.  Assuming they are willing to change any aspect
    ! of the software executed on the server, outline your advice to them
    ! by detailing one robust countermeasure.
4.o ! The maintainers of the server are considering a switch to TLS as a
    ! replacement for the similar, but proprietary, protocol used at the
    ! moment.  Do you think this could and/or would prevent the attack?
    ! Explain why, and any assumptions you make to form this conclusion.
5.o ! During a conversation about the attack, a colleague suggests to you
    ! that using a stream cipher (rather than the block cipher) could act 
    ! as a countermeasure.  Explain why they might think this, and identify
    ! a suitable stream cipher to use in this context.
