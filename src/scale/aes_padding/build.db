1.r ! In the scenario presented, the attack target leaks information via
    ! poor control over the error messages produced.  Imagine that it is
    ! upgraded so a single type of error is produced: either there is an
    ! error, or no error.  Explain whether or not, and how, you think 
    ! the attack might still be viable.
2.r ! The attack target uses a padding scheme whereby n+1 octets with the 
    ! value n are appended to the message st. the overall length is then
    ! a multiple of the block size.  Identify one alternative scheme, and
    ! explain how the attack might change as a result of using it.

3.o ! The maintainers of the server are keen to deploy a countermeasure
    ! against the attack.  Assuming they are willing to change any aspect
    ! of the software executed on the server, outline your advice to them
    ! by detailing one robust countermeasure.
4.o ! The maintainers of the server are considering a switch to TLS as a
    ! replacement for the similar, but proprietary, protocol used at the
    ! moment.  Do you think this could and/or would prevent the attack?
    ! Explain why, and any assumptions you make to form this conclusion.
5.o ! During a conversation about the attack, a colleague suggests to you
    ! that using a stream cipher (rather than the block cipher) could act 
    ! as a countermeasure.  Explain why they might think this, and identify
    ! a suitable stream cipher to use in this context.
